# SpringStep
SpringStep is a task-tracking productivity application. It is essentially a Kanban board and a Pomodoro Timer combined into one. It was made as a first-year university project.

# Features
- Create tasks that can be dragged to either "To Do", "Doing", or "Done" task lists
- Create multiple Kanban boards with their own "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" task lists.
- Pomodoro Timer that automatically starts and stops based on whether tasks are in progress, put aside for later, or completed
- Notification to alert the user whether it's time to work or time to take a short break
